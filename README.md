# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project builds and evaluates models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset.

## Files
- `fraud_detection.py` – end-to-end analysis (cleaning, EDA, modeling, evaluation)
- `fraud_detection_report.pdf` – full written report

## Dataset
Dataset: Kaggle "Credit Card Fraud Detection" (creditcard.csv)

Note: The dataset file is not included in this repository. Download `creditcard.csv` from Kaggle and place it in the project root (same folder as `fraud_detection.py`) before running.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and class imbalance handling
- Model training (baseline + tuned models)
- Evaluation with ROC and Precision-Recall curves

## Tools
Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
